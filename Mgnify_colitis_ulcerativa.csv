PRJEB27076;MGYA00168394_4.1;Sigmoid colon;NTNU;Introduction: 5- aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is the mainstay of treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). 5-ASA acts locally in the colonic mucosa and mucosal concentrations of 5-ASA are inversely correlated to disease activity. Previous studies have found large inter-individual variations in mucosal 5-ASA concentrations. Several explanatory models have been proposed, but is remains unintelligible why some patients have high 5-ASA concentrations, while others have low. Previous findings suggest that treatment with Asacol (pH-dependent release formulation) yields higher mucosal 5-ASA concentrations than Pentasa (time-dependent release formulation). The mucosal bacterial composition and fermentation products, such as short chain fatty acids, greatly impact pH-value in the colon and might therefore be correlated to 5-ASA concentration. Aim and method: In this cross-sectional non-randomized study, we have measured mucosal concentration of 5-ASA and its inactive metabolite acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) in the left hemicolon and rectum in patients with quiescent UC taking Mezavant, Asacol or Pentasa. Patients with quiescent UC using oral mesalazine monotherapy in the maximal dose recommended by the manufacturers (4.0-4.8g o.d.) were included. Eight hours after ingestion of mesalazine, patients underwent blood sample collection, followed by bowel preparation with enema and sigmoidoscopy. A total of six mucosal biopsies were collected 10, 25 and 40 cm from the anal verge. 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA concentrations were measured in five biopsies and serum by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mucosal and fecal microbiome was explored using 16srRNA sequencing. Disease activity was assessed by Mayo score (MS), Geboes histological score (GS) and measurement of plasma ESR, CRP, blood leukocytes and fecal calprotectin concentrations.;Mucosal microbiome and 5-ASA concentration in the left hemicolon and rectum in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis
PRJEB6905;MGYA00003344_1.0;Large intestine;University of Manchester - United Kingdom;The symbiotic relationship between gut microbiota and the host is necessary for intestinal homeostasis.  Loss of tolerance to the gut microbiota results in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohnâ€™s disease and Ulcerative colitis. The microbiota resides in two compartments-the gut lumen and mucus layer. Most published findings focus on luminal microbial communities in IBD pathogenesis with much less being understood about the bacteria resident in the mucus layer that abuts the epithelium. Thus, the precise interactions between microbiota and the intestinal mucosa during IBD development are still unknown. To address this, we investigated colitis progression in the mdr1a-/- spontaneous model of colitis. We examined microbiota composition in the mucus and lumen in mdr1a-/- mice and wild-type littermate controls at an early pre-colitic and a later post-colitic stage. We aim to identify if bacterial differences in specific niches  precede IBD development and progression. Our study provides valuable insight in microbiota-host interactions in normal and diseased states, revealing new approaches for the management of IBD.;Changes in microbiota composition in colitis-prone mdr1a mice

Chan School of Public Health;The main Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Multi'omics Database (IBDMDB) study includes multi'omics measurements from over 100 subjects, sampled biweekly over up to a year in both adult and pediatric patients with IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), along with non-IBD controls. Data types include fecal metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, metabolomes, and proteomes, as well as host genetics, intestinal biopsy transcriptomes, epigenetics, and 16S amplicon profiles. Subjects' medical histories and demographics are collected at baseline and medication, diet, and disease activity profiled longitudinally.;Longitudinal Multi'omics of the Human Microbiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
PRJEB20367;MGYA00589882_5.0;Midgut;GOTHENBURG UNIVERISITY;Diet strongly affects gut microbiota composition and gut bacteria can influence the colonic mucus layer, a physical barrier that separates trillions of gut bacteria from the host.  However, the interplay between a Western style diet (WSD), gut microbiota composition and the intestinal mucus layer is less clear.  Here we show that mice fed a WSD have an altered colonic microbiota composition that causes increased penetrability and a reduced growth rate of the inner mucus layer. Both barrier defects can be prevented by transplanting microbiota from chow-fed mice. In addition, we found that administration of Bifidobacterium longum was sufficient to restore mucus growth whereas administration of the fiber inulin prevented increased mucus penetrability in WSD-fed mice. We hypothesize that the presence of distinct bacteria is crucial for proper mucus function.  If confirmed in humans, these findings may help to better understand diseases with an affected mucus layer, such as ulcerative colitis.;Bifidobacterium or fiber protect against diet-induced microbiota-mediated colonic mucus deterioration
PRJEB23489;MGYA00140029_4.0;Fecal;MIT;Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a treatment for microbiome-associated diseases in which gut microbiota are transferred from a healthy donor to a patient. Although the success of FMT requires donor bacteria to engraft in the patient's gut, the forces governing bacterial engraftment in humans are unknown. Here, we use a vast, ongoing clinical experiment - the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection with FMT - to uncover the rules of engraftment in humans. First, we built a machine learning model that accurately predicts which bacterial species will engraft in a given host. We then developed a maximum-likelihood strain inference method, Strain Finder, allowing us to infer the genotypes of donor strains and to track them through patients' guts over time. Surprisingly, engraftment could be predicted largely from the abundance and phylogeny of bacteria in the donor and the pre-FMT patient. We also found that donor strains within a species engraft in an all-or-nothing manner and that previously undetected strains frequently colonize the patient after FMT. We validated these findings in another disease context, metabolic syndrome, suggesting that the same principles of engraftment extend to other indications. These findings may guide the design of bacterial therapeutics that target diseases ranging from ulcerative colitis to cancer.;16S data from FMT trial for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection
