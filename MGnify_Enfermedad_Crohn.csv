PRJNA46321,MGYA00000204_1.0,Fecal,NIDDK,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease, are chronic, immunologically mediated disorders that have severe medical consequences. The current hypothesis is that these diseases are due to an overly aggressive immune response to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. Studies to date on IBD have suggested that the disorder may be caused by a combination of bacteria and host susceptibility; however the etiologies of these diseases remain an enigma. 
In this application, we propose to develop and demonstrate the ability to profile Crohn’s disease at an unprecedented molecular level by elucidation of specific biomarkers (bacterial strains, genes, or proteins) that correlate to disease symptoms. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach based on metagenomic and metaproteomic molecular tools to elucidate the composition of the commensal microbiota in monozygotic twins that are either healthy or exhibit Crohn’s disease (for concordant, both are diseased; for discordant, one is healthy and one is diseased). 
The central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohn’s disease as compared to healthy individuals, and (2) that it will be possible to elucidate microbial signatures which correlate with the occurrence and progression of this disease by integration of data obtained from 16S rRNA-based molecular fingerprinting, metagenomics, and metaproteomics approaches. To address these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Obtain data on community gene content (metagenome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess potential differences in the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiota associated with CD, 2) Obtain data on community protein content (metaproteome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess the state of expressed proteins associated with CD, 3) Apply various statistical clustering and classification methods to correlate/associate microbial community composition, gene and protein content with patient metadata, including metabolite profiles and clinical phenotype. 
The ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms. 
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to Crohn’s disease by using a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of patient cohorts who have Crohn’s disease. These results will be compared with those obtained from the study of healthy individuals and have the potential to identify new biomarkers of disease severity, location, and progression.",Human Gut Microbiome in Crohn's Disease
None,MGYA00373091_4.1,Fecal,UPENNBL,"Dysbiosis in the human intestines, an alteration in the normal composition of the microbiota, characterizes a wide spectrum of diseases, such as infections, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease. Dysbiosis has been studied extensively but typically characterized cross-sectionally and as alterations in bacterial taxonomic proportions.  The longitudinal contributions of diet, antibiotic use, and inflammation on the evolution of dysbiosis during therapy for Crohn's disease have not been well characterized. Here we used shot-gun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples collected from a longitudinal prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease subjects to analyze the representation and gene content of all types of organisms present, including bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses.  Patients initiated treated with either antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha or enteral nutrition per the treating physician.  Multivariate analysis showed that microbiome composition was associated with three environmental stressors--intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and diet.  Bacterial gene signatures suggested that communities in Crohn's samples were responding to oxidative stress. Antibiotic use was associated with a more dysbiotic composition of the bacterial microbiota as well as a distinctive increase in fungal organisms and human DNA content. In contrast, the abundance of tailed phage and archaea was similar in feces of children with Crohn's disease and healthy controls.  Composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were highly correlated. Dysbiosis in bacterial and fungal communities was reduced in patients with reduction of intestinal inflammation by either therapy. Diet had an independent and rapid effect on gut microbiota composition within one week of initiation. Evidently dysbiosis characteristic of Crohn's disease results in part from inflammation and antibiotic use, and involves correlated changes in bacterial and eukaryotic community members.  Notably, the three stressors were independently associated with different bacteria and different gene pathways, reflecting concurrent disruption of normal homeostasis by multiple mechanisms. Thus, while dysbiosis in general is common to multiple disease states, the nature of the dysbiosis is unique to the environmental stressor.","Inflammation, Antibiotics, and Diet as Concurrent Environmental Stressors of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Crohn's Disease"

The taxonomical and functional analyses on unassembled and assembled sequence reads, following two different approaches allows as to compare the viral and microbial communities between both groups in study in several ways. For example we compared by group (controls vs patients), by entity (viruses vs bacteria), by reads assembly (assembled vs unassembled reads) and by methodology (our approach vs an existing pipeline).",Crohn's Disease viral and microbial metagenome

PRJEB19825,MGYA00144498_4.1,Human,UCSDMI,"Understanding the normal temporal variation in the human microbiome is critical to developing treatments for putative microbiome-related afflictions such as obesity, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and malnutrition. Sequencing and computational technologies however have been a limiting factor in performing dense timeseries analysis of the human microbiome. Here we present the largest human microbiota timeseries analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints. Results: We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, daily fluctuations in an individual's microbiota appear characteristic. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total within body site microbial communities appears to be present across all time points, suggesting that if a core temporal microbiome exists it is small. Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members. DNA sequencing and computational advances described here provide the ability to go beyond infrequent snapshots of our human-associated microbial ecology to high-resolution assessments of temporal variations over protracted periods, within and between body habitats and individuals. This capacity will allow us to define normal variation and pathologic states, and for assessing responses to therapeutic interventions.",Moving pictures of the human microbiome
